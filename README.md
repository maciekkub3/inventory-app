📦 Inventory Management App  
This is a mobile application for managing warehouse inventory, developed as part of my engineering thesis.  
It was my first Android project, so the code may be a bit messy in places — but it represents a full working  
solution that I’m proud to have built from scratch while learning Android development.

📱 About the App  
The Inventory Management App is designed to help warehouse workers and administrators keep track of stock,
move products efficiently, and monitor inventory changes. It supports QR code scanning, role-based access control,
and real-time database updates using Firebase.

💡 Features  
📦 Product Management: Add, edit, and remove products in each warehouse section.  
🔍 QR Code Scanning: Quickly scan products to update their quantity.  
🏢 Warehouse Selection: Users choose their assigned warehouse before starting.
🔁 Inventory History: View logs of all changes (adds/removals).  
📊 Reports: Generate simple inventory summaries (WIP).  
🔐 Firebase Authentication & Firestore: Secure, real-time backend.  

👤 User Roles:  
Owner – Full access to all warehouses and user management.  
Admin – Manages their own warehouse section.  
Worker – Can modify products, generate reports and browse history in their assigned warehouses.
